## After graduating from University of California Davis, I decided to dive deeper into web development and initially got a sample when I would modify the HTML on my MySpace profile more than a decade ago. I wanted to get a better understanding and took the initiative to take Harvard's CS50 course to widen my scope of the coding languages and DSA, leading me to creating silly games using Scratch which truly opened my mind to what was possible.

## Months later, I have completed App Academy's 24-week web development program and I now have several frameworks under my belt including Javascript, Python, Flask, Express, React, and Redux. During the 60 to 80-hour work weeks, I developed three full-stack websites, including one in a team environment. Most importantly, the experience taught me how to efficiently learn new languages by being self proficient.

## Aside from coding, my hobbies include cars, traveling, and trying different types of foods. I love meeting new people! Let's chat
